Programming Languages

We have lots of programming languages to choose from. Here are some of my favorites.

My Top 3 Programming Languages:

Lanuguage
Inventor
Tools and Frameworks
Why I like it

JavaScript
Brendan Eich
jQuery, React, Angular, etc.
This flexible language is everywhere!

Ruby
Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto
Rails
Ruby is fun to write and easy to look at!

Java
James Gosling
Spring
The language is pretty verbose, but super safe. Plus, Java runs all the businesses in the world.
